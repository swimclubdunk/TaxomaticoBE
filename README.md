When navigating the waters of the Belgian tax system, I got fed up doing the math to calculate freelance rates. I needed a solution that allowed me to adjust and tweak values, and see the results at runtime.

So I made one, and this is that. I'm not an accountant, tax professional or lawyer, and I can take no responsability for any use or misuse of this software.

The application uses data for the tax year 2024. An updated version with tax data for 2025, and perhaps previous years for comparison will soon follow.
